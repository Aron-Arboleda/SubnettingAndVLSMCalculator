            <h2>Creating Sub-networks</h2>
                <p>Subnetting in networking is a vital practice that involves dividing a larger IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks. This process optimizes IP address allocation, reduces broadcast domain sizes, and enhances overall network performance. Subnetting also contributes to improved security by isolating network segments, facilitates simplified network management, and supports scalability through a modular and hierarchical structure. By employing subnetting, administrators can efficiently organize, secure, and scale their networks, making it a fundamental skill in network design and maintenance.</p>
                <h3>Two techniques used in IP network design:</h3>
                    <h4>Subnetting</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Subnetting is the process of dividing a large IP network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks or subnets. In traditional subnetting, a single subnet mask is used for the entire network, and all subnets within that network have the same subnet mask.</li>
                        <li>With standard subnetting, the subnet masks are fixed for all subnets, and they are based on the network's original subnet mask. This can sometimes result in inefficient use of IP addresses, especially when subnets have significantly different numbers of hosts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>VLSM is an extension of subnetting that allows for the use of different subnet masks within the same network. This means that subnets can have variable lengths and sizes, allowing for a more flexible allocation of IP addresses.</li>
                        <li>With VLSM, administrators can allocate larger subnets with longer masks to network segments that require more hosts, and smaller subnets with shorter masks to segments with fewer hosts. This results in a more efficient use of IP addresses and can help prevent address space wastage.</li>
                        <li>VLSM is particularly useful in hierarchical network designs where subnets have varying requirements for the number of hosts.</li>
                    </ul>
